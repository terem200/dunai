### Steps to run locally.
You need to have **Golang** programming language installed on your machine. So far I recommend you to use v1.17.5 

1. Add the ``config.json`` to ```/config``` directory. You can find an example there.
2. Run 
```gotemplate
go run cmd/main.go
```
OR
```bash
make
```
```bash
./main
```
### Unit Tests
```bash
make test
